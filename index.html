    <h2>Vijay manadu 2025</h2>
    <p>Madurai is abuzz with anticipation as Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) holds its second state conference today (Thursday, August 21, 2025) at Parapathi in Kariyapatti taluk. The grand event is being organised on a sprawling 500-acre ground along the Madurai–Thoothukudi National Highway at Parapathi in the district. Currently, #TVKVettriMaanadu is trending in India.

Actor-turned-politician Vijay, who heads TVK, reached Madurai late on Wednesday to a rousing reception from supporters. Thousands of cadres and admirers, many of them families, have already arrived at the venue, setting the stage for what is expected to be one of the biggest political gatherings in recent years.</p>

In preparation, organisers have taken extra measures after last year’s Vikravandi conference saw attendees suffer from heat-related issues. Drinking water facilities, medical assistance and crowd-control mechanisms have been strengthened to manage the expected turnout of around four lakh people.</p>
<h2>TVK Maanadu: A Platform To Deliver Vijay's Political Message</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The conference is widely seen as a crucial step in the party’s run-up to the 2026 Assembly elections.</li>
    <li>Political observers note that Vijay’s messaging could aim to project 2026 as a potential turning point, drawing comparisons with the transformative elections of 1967 and 1977.</li>
    <li>The Vikravandi event in Villupuram district last year marked the party’s first major political outing, but today’s conference in Madurai is viewed as its defining moment.</li>
    <li>With the state elections just months away, Vijay’s speech is expected to set the tone for his campaign against both the ruling DMK and the BJP-led government at the Centre.</li>
